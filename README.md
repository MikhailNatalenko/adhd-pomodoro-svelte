# Well....

It's hard to explain, but somehow this is the perfect pomodoro timer that I use
every day. I have tried a lot of implementations but they don't realy suit me. 




``` bash
npm install  
npm run dev # to build and run locally

npm run build 
npm run deploy # this is how I deploy it to gh pages
```
